# Release Notes - Bramble v1.2.1

## üêõ Bug Fix Release

This patch release addresses a critical configuration bug and adds enhanced branch visibility features to improve the user experience when working with repositories that have both local and remote branches.

## üõ† Critical Bug Fix

### Remote Branches Configuration

- **Fixed**: The `includeRemoteBranches` configuration option was not being properly respected in the GitAnalyzer
- **Impact**: Users who set `includeRemoteBranches=false` were still seeing remote branches in their analysis
- **Resolution**: Updated the branch data gathering logic to correctly filter remote branches based on user configuration

## ‚ú® New Features

### Branch Type Visibility

- **Branch Type Column**: Added a new "Type" column to the branch list view
  - Shows "LOCAL" for local branches
  - Shows "REMOTE" for remote branches  
  - Helps users quickly identify branch origins at a glance

- **Enhanced Repository Statistics**: The repository overview now provides detailed branch breakdowns:
  
  ```text
  Total Branches: 45
  - Local Branches: 42
  - Remote Branches: 3
  ```

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Improved Column Layout**: Adjusted branch list column widths to accommodate the new type information
- **Updated Legend**: Enhanced UI legend to explain the LOCAL vs REMOTE indicators
- **Better Information Density**: More context available without cluttering the interface

## üîß Technical Improvements

- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript type definitions with new `BranchType` enum
- **Robust Branch Handling**: Improved mapping between different Git reference formats (refs/heads/ vs refs/remotes/)
- **Configuration Validation**: Better validation and enforcement of the `includeRemoteBranches` setting

## üéØ Use Case Benefits

### Repository Maintenance

- **Quick Remote Branch Identification**: Easily spot remote branches that may need cleanup
- **Local vs Remote Context**: Better understanding of branch distribution across local and remote repositories
- **Configuration Control**: Reliable filtering of remote branches when not needed

### Team Collaboration

- **Branch Origin Clarity**: Team members can quickly identify which branches are local vs pushed to remote
- **Workflow Optimization**: Better visibility into branch status for merge and cleanup decisions

## üöÄ Compatibility

- **Fully Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes from v1.2.0
- **Configuration Preserved**: All existing configuration settings remain unchanged
- **Performance**: No impact on analysis performance

## üîÑ Upgrade Guide

Simply update to v1.2.1 to get the bug fix and new features:

```bash
npm install -g @risadams/bramble@1.2.1
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To control remote branch visibility:

```bash
# Include remote branches (default)
bramble config --set includeRemoteBranches=true

# Exclude remote branches  
bramble config --set includeRemoteBranches=false
```

## üôè Acknowledgments

Thank you to users who reported the remote branches configuration issue. This release ensures that Bramble respects your configuration preferences while providing better visibility into your repository's branch structure.
