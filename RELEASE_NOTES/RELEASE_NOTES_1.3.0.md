*Released: August 20, 2025*

## üéâ Major Release: Enterprise Features Complete

Bramble 1.3.0 represents a **major milestone** in the evolution of our Git repository analysis tool. This release completes our enterprise feature roadmap with three significant new capabilities that transform Bramble into a comprehensive, professional-grade repository management solution.

## üöÄ What's New

### üè• Repository Health Monitoring
Get comprehensive insights into your repository's health with our new 6-dimension analysis system:

- **Code Quality**: Analyze commit patterns, branch naming conventions, and repository structure
- **Security**: Detect potential security issues and branch management problems  
- **Collaboration**: Evaluate team collaboration patterns and contributor activity
- **Maintenance**: Assess repository maintenance health and technical debt indicators
- **Activity**: Monitor commit frequency, contributor engagement, and project velocity
- **Structure**: Analyze branch organization, merge patterns, and repository architecture

```bash
# Generate comprehensive health report
bramble analyze --health

# Export health report to markdown
bramble analyze --health --health-export health-report.md

# Analyze specific health dimensions
bramble analyze --health-dimensions codeQuality,security,collaboration
```

**Health Score Example**: The system provides actionable insights with scores like "59/100" along with specific recommendations for improvement.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration System
Enterprise-grade configuration management with profiles and environments:

#### Configuration Profiles
Pre-built profiles optimized for different use cases:
- **Enterprise**: Large teams, strict compliance (500+ branches, 14-day stale threshold)

- **Personal**: Individual projects, lightweight settings (20 branches, 60-day threshold)
- **Team**: Small to medium teams, agile workflows (50 branches, 21-day threshold)
- **Custom**: Fully customizable base template

```bash
# List available profiles
bramble profiles list

# Use enterprise profile
bramble profiles use builtin-enterprise

# Create custom profile
bramble profiles create "My Team Profile"

# Show profile details
bramble profiles show builtin-enterprise
```

#### Environment Management
Support for environment-specific configuration overrides:
- **Development**: Local development settings
- **Staging**: Pre-production configuration  
- **Production**: Production-ready settings
- **Testing**: Test environment optimizations
- **Local**: Personal workspace settings

```bash
# List environments
bramble environments list

# Set active environment
bramble environments set development

# Use profile with specific environment
bramble profiles use builtin-enterprise production
```

#### Configuration Templates
Automated setup workflows and templates for quick configuration:

```bash
# List available templates
bramble templates list

# Apply template to create new profile
bramble templates apply enterprise-template
```
